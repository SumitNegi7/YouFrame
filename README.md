You can click on upload button to upload a image and it will directly be uploaded to the folder and it will automatically re-render the page

To run it on you system clone it with SSH or Https link then run
npm install
and then run both the frontend and backend servers
frontend is inside frontend folder : cd frontend => npm start
and backend is in the root folder only  =>node server.js

I have also deployed the project on heroku:

https://desolate-earth-66096.herokuapp.com/

Server might run slow as it is freely hosted


Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML,CSS ,React
Backend: Node.js , Express.js
